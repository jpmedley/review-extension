# webdevextension

## TODO

* 404 links
* Correct order of H
* Quotes around link text
* Tables should have `w-table-wrapper`
* Links to web.dev pages should omit `https://web.dev`
* Link with anchor should jump to section... this is probably automatable...
  get the hash and then check for an element with that ID
* Use PSI to find performance problems
* Blog post only has the `blog` tag
* Videos should not be hosted in the repository
* Remove `en-US` from MDN links… make it more generic though…
* Acronyms should be defined before using (this one might be difficult to automate)
* Chromium, not Chrome
